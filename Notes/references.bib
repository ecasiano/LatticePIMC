	Abstract = {In this post, I'm going to continue on the same theme from the last post: random sampling. We're going to look at two methods for sampling a distribution: rejection sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods (MCMC) using the Metropolis Hastings algorithm. As usual, I'll be providing a mix of intuitive explanations, theory and some examples with code. Hopefully, this will help explain a relatively straight-forward topic that is frequently presented in a complex way.},

@article{Prokof_ev_1998,
	Abstract = {We show how the worldline quantum Monte Carlo procedure, which usually relies on an
artificial time discretization, can be formulated directly in continuous time, rendering the scheme
exact. For an arbitrary system with discrete Hilbert space, none of the configuration update
procedures contain small parameters. We find that the most effective update strategy involves the
motion of worldline discontinuities ~both in space and time!, i.e., the evaluation of the
Green's function. Being based on local updates only, our method nevertheless allows one to
work with the grand canonical ensemble and nonzero winding numbers, and to calculate any
dynamical correlation function as easily as expectation values of, e.g., total energy. The
principles found for the update in continuous time generalize to any continuous variables in the
space of discrete virtual transitions, and in principle also make it possible to simulate
continuous systems exactly. },

@article{FARHI1992182,
	Abstract = {Starting with any Hamiltonian and a countable basis we construct a functional integral for the matrix elements of the time evolution operator of the quantum system. Our functional integral consists of a real measure on continuous time paths along with a complex weighting function of the paths. The paths spend time at points corresponding to elements of the basis. We show directly, by cancelling paths, that the functional integral gives rise to unitary time evolution. We illustrate our general construction with a number of examples including the quantum mechanics of the Schr{\"o}dinger and Dirac particles in one space dimension.},

@article{PROKOFEV1998253,
	Abstract = {We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo scheme which allows efficient calculations of the Green function at finite temperature and the study of large disordered systems. The scheme is ergodic, works with non-zero winding numbers and in the grand canonical ensemble. The central idea is using a pair of worldline discontinuities for sampling the extended configuration space of the system which includes both closed and disconnected worldlines. The method is illustrated by simulations of pure and disordered bosonic Hubbard models in 1D.},
